  In my previous job, my main work is to design, develop `and` create applications within a cloud-native environment.

  I worked for the cafeteria group, `and` mainly worked in payment architecture, 
  , we have about `several million` transactions to deal with for a year, qps to be `1000 per second` in rush time, we provide a unified api layer to make these `30% performance improvement` `and` reusable in a new scenery, if you interest in this, I can detail you later.

  besides this I also do some maintenance `and` operation jobs, tunning `and` optimized database query, `and` something like that.

  I really enjoy working with going, by the way, because I can focus on business compared to another language and so on, also it solved a lot of pain points.
  So in order to keep that smoothy I have to know well about backend develop technology , such as cache, database, distribution system `and` do on.


- personality  
  As regards me, I describe myself as `deliverable` and `responsible`, I believe it's very important to be responsible for the things I work for, and answer for the consequences, Furthermore,  I always value much to make the delivery on time.
    besides this, as you know that in China, the culture that we have to be very `proactive`, and I think it's good quality.
