## most preference applications to recommend   
telegram 感觉像写广告呢  
  
top features:  
1. Functional and Interaction logic:  
  It's very straightforward, you can have only a Groups and Channels list,  
  You just move in, and chat. they do not have any other function.  
  that is different from the acquaintances social im, there you have a friends list, and personal space to show sth, they do not appear in here telegram.  
  You do not have to add a friend before you start a talk. you can add people to contact, but it's up to you, not bothway.  
  
  
2. Layers of Social  
	Strangers can not just search and join in, as we know in wechat or qq, we may on a whim and search by some keyword, and then you see some group, pick up some of them, you do not sure what actually this group is for, or you do not know well about it. So there are many kinds of people around the group. So totally strangers do not make it easy to start a good communication.   
  
	The difference is, telegram groups often shared by friends or pasted in some communities, and you can enjoy a good talk more often.  
  
3. Freedom and Privacy  
    You can talk about anything on this chat app, your data will not be analyzed, and other topics like web3 in investment or like politics is can be discussed in this app.  
  
    Besides this, you can burn your information any time, and after that others can not see it anymore, and you also have it to be deleted automatically, by settings, although I do not use it very much, is it's a good feature.  

    But be cautious, on the contrary, they do not have a good government of the users, they do not provide customer service, and you can do anything, of cource it will do some harm for you. So be cautious about like fraud, or some unfriendly words, And it is also filled with much bad information, like porngraph, or abuse of little girl like "Nth Room", is the famous incident that base on the telegram, but if you do not like the information, the only thing you cant do is, just quit the channel.  

  
  
  
4. On the tech part, they open source their encrypt protocol and Encryption algorithm, there are API provided by them, it means it can be programmable that you make something automate, through this, you can custom your own logic, you also can set up a bot, which I like the most, you can make many things automatic by only several clicks, It can help you do many things. it's convenient.  
  
  
  
5. It's a good news source, you can join many foreign groups, you can talk to them, in Chinese, maybe also in English, on many topics.  
this makes you knowledge of other parts of the world. there are many people there, some of them are very good quality, you can make friends, and talk to them you can advance yourself.
