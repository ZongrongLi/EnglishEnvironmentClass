today we're talking about the top 10 project management responsibilities 

well you can find lists out there of these responsibilities 
but specifically today I want to focus on daily in weekly tasks
in essence people want to know 
what's the day in the life of a project manager

what do I do again daily and weekly 

so when we look at daily responsibilities 
we're looking at things like 


**email**  
email returning emails or sending emails in a timely manner  
**call**  
making any kind of calls that you need to as follow-up or if someone calls just again

following up with them or calling to ask questions to clarify things

**meetings**  

another is meetings so sometimes you have meetings with it 
could be the team members or any kind of third party
vendor partners or even your stakeholders 

**dashboard**  
also keeping an eye on your
dashboard so a dashboard is a graphical picture of 
how your project is doing 
so you want to look at things like 
how are we doing on our timeline 
how are we doing on our budget 
how are we doing on delivering the scope and 
those type of things that we want to watch on our dashboard 

**daily project status**  
we also want to track the
`daily project status` like where are wesupposed to be today
so if there are tasks that are supposed to be completed today or even milestones
take a look at where you are are you in progress are they completing as scheduled


**team**  
also it's great to take a check-in on your team 
check in with your team and make sure they're not stuck 
sometimes team members could be stuck maybe they're waiting on information from another group 
that you make it helped resolve or escalate or they may need some training
or they may just be stumped on how to approach a different task that they're working on


**issues risk**  
also making ensuring that `issues risk`
and any changes are being addressed you want to make sure they're logged 
and being addressed by the project team 

**time sheets**  
also time sheets we found that if timesheets are done daily 
your information or your time is being tracked more reasonable 
instead of waiting more until an extended period of time 

say if people log their time you know at the end of the week or at end of the month 
or even longer periods of the project 
we find that it gets to be more of a guesstimate 

**daily checklist**  
so we also want to keep a `daily checklist` 
things that you want to ensure that by the end of the day that
you resolve 


**budget/expenditures**  
and then also keeping an eye on your budget versus your expenditures
because the the closer that you can keep those things resolved the better

**weekly things**  
so also we want to look at what are some of the weekly things that we do 
so we also there's a daily project status but also a weekly 
like through the week are we are we where we're supposed to be 

**overall project status**  
also the overall project status so at this point in time 
say in this period of time of this week are we where we're supposed to be 
in the overall scheme of the project 
if not begin resolving those issues and finding out where the issues
or problems may be 

also again 

**monitoring a dashboard**  
`monitoring a dashboard` on a weekly basis to ensure graphically those components of your budget your scope ,the timeline all of those things are being on track 
 
**providing a stakeholder summary**  
we found by keeping our stakeholders informed it keeps them at ease that the project is keeping on track and that any issues are being resolved because we may need 

change controle board , if there is changes make sure that changes are addressed and decided.




**timesheet approvals**  
typically on most projects the timesheets are approved at the end of the week so that
invoicing can be done so invoices may be sent to the client they may be sent to third parties and so that you want to keep that that going on a regular basis


**weekly kickoff**  
    so also a `weekly kickoff` 
    I start my Mondays by looking at for the week what are the things that week I need to do. 
    and for the wrap-up on Friday I look at all the things I was due to complete that week 


did I complete them?

if not do they need to carry over to the next week 

I just need to close them out

are they still important or they not important anymore 

so I clean that list up so I start the next Monday 

so it's kind of rinse and repeat the Monday

through Friday


**weekly checklist**  

**team appreciation**  
    and then also being able to invoke some team appreciation
    keep your team encouraged keep them inspired and just acknowledge them for the work that they're doing on the team

**lessons learned**  
    and tracking lessons learned because what we found is with lessons learned you want to incorporate them as soon as possible along the way instead of waiting to the end of the project capturing those lessons when it's really too late
    

through it may not be daily or weekly 
but it's really ongoing is to continue your self-development 
any kind of growth opportunities and coaching or mentoring
not only for yourself but also for your team 


``` 冗长的filterwords
and then also for these I guess I have some extra tips as well so
```
 **make meetings productive**  
remembering that to `make meetings productive`, 
start them on time in them on time 
and most of all have fun 
so you can work hard and have fun 



and then make calls personable and intentional 


if you make calls or set up a call be sure that you set the intention 
so that the other person knows like why are we having this call 

大家想带走什么
what does everybody want to leave with 

这只是信息还是你需要带着决定离开
is it just information or you do you need to leave with the decision 

**also leave meetings with closure` ]
and action items of knowing who's supposed to do what when and where

**resolve issues**  
and then resolve issues
不要让问题继续堆积，挥之不去
don't let issues keep building and lingering on .
because they typically get worse 

as they go 


**clarify any ambiguity**  
because if you leave things unclear then it just if people are not sure what they're working on 
or maybe not clear on expectations again 
it just causes trouble down the line 

**ask questions**  
and then `ask questions` just continue to ask questions of your team of your vendor partners 

of your stakeholders that provides a lot of information and 

只是让人们对他们所做的事负责
just keeps people accountable to what they're doing 


**stakeholders informed**  
and also keeping your stakeholders informed 
always helps
